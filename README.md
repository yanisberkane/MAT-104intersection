# Mathematics - 104intersection Project
Language: Python

To create synthesis images (when doing ray tracing, for example), potential intersection points between light rays and scene objects (here cylinders, spheres and cones) must be computed..
With writing a 3 dimensional equation of the considered surface, and injecting into it the equation of the straight line representing the light ray. Youâ€™ll get a quadratic equation, with 0, 1, 2 or an infinite number of solutions that will give you the intersection points coordinates.
The straight line is defined by the coordinates of a point by which it passes through and the coordinates of a parallel vector.
O being the origin of the coordinate system, and X, Y and Z the axis, the surfaces that must be handled in this project are:
  - O-centered spheres,
  - Cylinders of revolution around Z axis,
  - Cones of revolution around Z axis whose apex is O.
